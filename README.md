# Another_Portfolio_React

The React deployment of my "Portfolio AGAIN HAHA"

Original Work & Non-Deployment Version can be found

[Here](https://github.com/Serrowxd/Another_Portfolio)

[React Version](https://github.com/Serrowxd/Another_Portfolio/tree/master/React)

Netlify doesn't allow for deployment inside folders without webpack and I'm too lazy to set that all up right now.
